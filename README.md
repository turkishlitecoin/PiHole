PiHole_Blocklists

Lists contained within this repo have been gathered from multiple sources on www and GH and permission to use/re-se them has be granted by the original creators.
Please feel free to add links to your PiHole.

When uploading multiple lists to PiHole, a single list can get extracted from the /etc/pihole/gravity.list file, and uploaded to GH.
Single list will increae false positive rate, but creating whitelists will reduce the frequency of these.

I am currently working on a NoTrack setup which has been tipped as being better than PiHole in many areas. Domain lists can be used on both platforms.
